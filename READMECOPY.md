## Project Overview
This project focuses on churn analysis for a telecom company using a full BI + ML pipeline. It combines SQL data processing, Power BI dashboarding, and Python machine learning to predict customer churn and identify business improvement opportunities.

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL (Data Cleaning & Transformation)
- Power BI (Dashboard Design)
- Python (Pandas, Scikit-learn, XGBoost)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Key Features
- Interactive Power BI dashboards to monitor churn metrics, customer segments, and service usage.
- Predictive modeling using Random Forest and XGBoost (achieved ~82% accuracy).
- Churn classification based on contract type, monthly charges, tenure, and service subscriptions.
- ML outputs exported to Power BI for risk-based customer segmentation.

## Business Impact
Key Insights from the Churn Analysis
Churn Rate: Approximately 26.5% of customers were found to have churned. That’s a significant proportion and highlights a critical area to focus on for customer retention.

## Top Churn Reasons

- High monthly charges for short tenure customers.
- Lack of tech support and online security features.
- Customers using month-to-month contracts were more likely to churn.

## Demographics: Senior citizens had a higher churn rate.

Services Impact: Those without add-on services (like streaming TV or device protection) had higher churn rates.

Tenure Analysis: Customers in their early months (0–12 months) were more prone to churn.



## Recommended solutions: 
- promote annual contracts, add service bundles, and early loyalty interventions.
